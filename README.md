## Packup 2 for Android ðŸ“‹ðŸ“¸ðŸ“¦

Packup 2 is a total rewrite of my first app [Packup](https://github.com/ashwinravrao/Packup). Packup was an NFC-based home inventory tool and box tracker. With this second version of the app, I plan to make improvements to the usability one-handed, which will be supported by some intelligent features that leverage on-device computation. I wrote Packup over six years ago, and have learned a lot since then. My objective with this project is to provide real, usable functionality while demonstrating clean architecture principles and good software design.
