## Packup 2    📋   📸  📦

In 2019, I released [Packup](https://github.com/ashwinravrao/Packup), an NFC-based home inventory tool. Android development has changed a lot and I've learned a lot since then. The original app was great, and is still available to [download](https://github.com/ashwinravrao/Packup/releases). But I can do better.

Packup 2 is a modern take on home inventory that aims to leverage on-device AI to help you track and find items in your home. It's also my sandbox for demonstrating clean architecture principles, with major improvements to performance and usability.

### ⏳ AI Usage
Initially developed entirely without AI assistance (up to commit [`pre-ai`](https://github.com/ashwinravrao/Packup2/tree/pre-ai)). Subsequent work aided by Claude Code.
